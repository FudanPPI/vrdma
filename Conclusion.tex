\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}
In this paper, we design a unified RDMA virtualization framework, namely \sys, which consists of single user-space \sys core and vRNICs. In the \sys core, the unified management for vRNICs are achieved. In the user space virtual layer: the isolated and high-performance vRNICs are virtualized based on the VFs from SR-IOV; In the uniVerbs interfaces: uniRDMA uses shared files to realize general I/O channel for VMs and containers; the isolation of interface is ensured with mount namespace in containers; uniVebrs realizes zero-copy and bypassing virtual layer in RDMA data path, by mapping all RDMA resource between vRNIC and RDMA applications. The experimental results show that \sys has high performance close to native RDMA while meeting generality and management.
