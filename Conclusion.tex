In this paper, we design a unified RDMA virtualization framework, namely URN, which consists of single user-space URN core and vRNICs. In the URN core, the unified management for vRNICs are achieved. In the user space virtual layer: the isolated and high-performance vRNICs are virtualized based on the VFs from SR-IOV; In the uniVerbs interfaces: uniRDMA uses shared files to realize general I/O channel for VMs and containers; the isolation of interface is ensured with mount namespace in containers; uniVebrs realizes zero-copy and bypassing virtual layer in RDMA data path, by mapping all RDMA resource between vRNIC and RDMA applications. The experimental results show that URN has high performance close to native RDMA while meeting generality and management.
