RDMA network is gaining its popularity for high performance communication of distributed applications in datacenters. With virtualization becomes the de-facto layer of datacenters, RDMA network also needs to be virtualized. It is common for the datacenter to have virtual machine~(VM), container and sometimes container-in-virtual-machine as its basic resource provisioning entity. However, RDMA is virtualized in different ways for VMs and containers. And there is no coordination between the two resource users. To solve this problem, we present \sys~(unified virtual RDMA), which is a unified RDMA virtualization framework for both VMs and containers. In \sys, vRNICs (virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized in host user-space, the URN core manages the vRNIC backends,  virtual RDMA network and hardware resources, and the management center issues the control plane or data plane policies. In our evaluation, \sys can be deployed in hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
