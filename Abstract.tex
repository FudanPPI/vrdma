Supercomputing is more and more popular in most data-driven fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For effiecncy and elasticity, supercomputing is in cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments(virtual machines and containers). As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtulization is neccessary in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a generic RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of single virtual layer and general uniVerbs interfaces. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments with high-performance close to native RDMA.
