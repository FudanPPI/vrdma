RDMA network is gaining its popularity for high performance communication of distributed applications. As virtualization has becomes the de-facto layer of datacenters, RDMA network also needs to be virtualized. It is common for the datacenter to have virtual machine~(VM), container and sometimes container-in-virtual-machine as its basic resource provisioning entity. However, RDMA is virtualized in different ways for VMs and containers. And there is no coordination between the two resource users. To solve this problem, we present \sys~(unified virtual RDMA), which is a unified RDMA virtualization framework for both VMs and containers. Through a single point of management, RDMA resources could be flexibly allocated to VMs and containers. And with \sys, the server machine does not have to choose which virtualization form it is hosting, VMs or containers. In our evaluation, \sys can be deployed in hybrid virtualization environments with less than 5\% overhead compared to SR-IOV~(hardware virtualization) and 15\% overhead compared to \native.
