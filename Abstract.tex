Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For effiecncy and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments(virtual machines and containers). As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtulization is neccessary in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of centralized virtual layer and unified interfaces. 
% 分层介绍自身工作，重点突出特点，简化通用性表述
vRNICs(virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized in user space and mapped into isolated SR-IOV VFs. For generality, vRNIC I/O interfaces are constructed by shared memory and RDMA virtual resources in vRNICs are mapped to RDMA application in hybrid virtual environments to achive high-performance. 
% 测试结果量化表示
In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
