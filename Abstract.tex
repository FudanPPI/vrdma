Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For effiecncy and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments(virtual machines and containers). Unified virtulization is neccesary beacause of intergeated management and high utilization. As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtulization needs to be unified in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of mutiple vRNICs(virtual RDMA network interface cards) and centralized virtual layer.

% features: user-space -> manageability, driver -> generality, all map ->performance
In userspace, vRNICs are virtualized with basic RDMA device attributes. The driver of vRNICs is unified for containers and VMs. The virtual layer contructs each vRNIC and have a integrated management of whole virtual RDMA. Besides, the performance problems are sloved by maping RDMA resource between vRNICs and RDMA applications.
% 测试结果量化表示
In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
