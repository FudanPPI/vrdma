Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fields for its extreme high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For efficiency and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments (virtual machines and containers). Unified virtualization is necessary because of integrated management and high utilization. As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtualization needs to be unified in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of multiple vRNICs (virtual RDMA network interface cards) and centralized virtual layer.In userspace, vRNICs are virtualized with basic RDMA device attributes. The driver of vRNICs is unified for containers and VMs. The virtual layer constructs each vRNIC and has an integrated management of the whole virtual RDMA. Besides, the performance problems are solved by mapping RDMA resources between vRNICs and RDMA applications. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
