RDMA network is gaining its popularity for high performance communication of distributed applications in datacenters. With virtualization becomes the de-facto layer of datacenters, RDMA network also need to be virtualized. It is common for the datacenter to have virtual machine, container and sometimes container-in-virtual-machine as its basic resource provisioning entity. However, RDMA is virtualized in different ways for virtual machines and containers. And there is no coordination between the two resource users. To solve this problem, we present UVA (Unified Virtual rdmA), which is a unified RDMA virtualization framework. In UVA, vRNICs (virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized in host user-space, the URN core manages the vRNIC backends,  virtual RDMA network and hardware resources, and the management center issues the control plane or data plane policies. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
