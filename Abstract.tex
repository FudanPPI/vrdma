Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fields for its extreme high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For efficiency and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments (virtual machines and containers). RDMA is basic high-performance network in supercomputing. In hybrid virtual environments, unified RDMA virtualization is necessary because of integrated management and high resource utilization. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions is not unified. To solve this problem, we present URN, which is a unified RDMA network virtualization framework. In URN, vRNICs (virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized in host user-space and the URN core manages the vRNIC backends,  virtual RDMA network and hardware resources. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
