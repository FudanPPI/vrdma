Supercomputing is important in most data-driven fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as such as artificial intelligence and large-scale data processing. As the developement of cloud, supercomputing is also in virtual machines or containers for effiecncy and elasticity. Today, hybrid virtual enviroments is a trend in most datacenters because of combined advatanges and historic reasons. RDMA is neccesay in supercomputing for its high network performance. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack centralized virtualization layer and general interfaces for hybrid virtual environments. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a generic RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of single virtual layer and general uniVerbs interfaces. The centralized user space virtual layer constructs multiple isolated vRNICs(virtual RDMA NICs) with the help of hardware virtualization technology and realizes a unified virtual RDMA network. To realize both generality and high-performance, uniVerbs interfaces use shared memory as I/O approach for RDMA applications and map RDMA resources to vRNIC. In our evaluation based on uniRDMA prototype, the performance and scalability of uniRDMA is close to bare-metal RDMA in virtual machines, containers and hybrid cloud environments.
