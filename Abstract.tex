Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For effiecncy and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments(virtual machines and containers). As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtulization is neccessary in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of centralized virtual layer and unified interfaces.

% features: user-space -> manageability, driver -> generality, all map ->performance
For higher managability, vRNICs(virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized in user space and mapped into isolated SR-IOV VFs in physical RNIC. The driver of vRNICs is unified for containers and VMs and vRNICs' RDMA resources(including data) are mapped with applications in both VMs and containers to get high performance.
% 测试结果量化表示
In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
