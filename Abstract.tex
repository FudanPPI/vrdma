Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fields for its extreme high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For efficiency and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments (virtual machines and containers). RDMA is basic high-performance network in supercomputing. In hybrid virtual environments, unified RDMA virtualization is necessary because of integrated management and high resource utilization. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions is not unified. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework. In uniRDMA, vRNICs (virtual RDMA network interface cards) are virtualized with basic RDMA attributes (e.g. QP) in host user-space. In VMs or containers, the driver of vRNICs is unified and vRNICs' RDMA resources are mapped to applications for performance. The virtual layer manages vRNICs' instantiation (including mapping vRNIC to physical cards) and constructs a virtual RDMA network. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments within 5\% overhead to native RDMA.
