Supercomputing is more and more popular in many fileds for its extrem high-performance, such as artificial intelligence and big data processing. For effiecncy and elasticity, supercomputing is going cloud recently, especially hybrid virtual environments(virtual machines and containers). As the high-performance network of supercomputing, RDMA virtulization is neccessary in hybrid virtual environments. However, existing RDMA virtualization solutions lack generality or performance. To solve this problem, we present uniRDMA, a unified RDMA software virtualization framework that consists of centralized virtual layer and unified interfaces. Virtual layer is located in user space to virtualize and manage multiple vRNICs(virtual RDMA network interface cards) which are mapped into isolated SR-IOV VFs. Unified interfaces are constructed for containers and VMs, and RDMA resource are mapped between applications and vRNICs to achive high-performance. In our evaluation, uniRDMA can be deployed in large-scale hybrid virtual environments with high-performance close to native RDMA.
